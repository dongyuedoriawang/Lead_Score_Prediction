# Lead_Score_Prediction

This is the project I individually work on when interning in the Data Science team at Peloton Interactive in Summer 2019. The main purpose of this project is to predict the probability of conversion for all the consumer leads that were captured from different sources and platforms and assign score based on their probability. 

Input data files were completely retrieved from internal datasets, which include consumer online visiting history, workout information, and digital user history, etc. The defined time window for target variable is 60 days, which means that we were trying to predict the probability of converting to a paid customer in the next 60 days for each consumer lead.
